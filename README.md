# Deep-Learning-with-Keras-Sentiment-Analysis-of-Reviews
Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that focuses on the development and training of artificial neural networks to perform tasks such as image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and more. One popular and widely used framework for implementing deep learning models is Keras.

**Introduction to Deep Learning:**

Deep learning involves the use of neural networks, which are computational models inspired by the structure and functioning of the human brain. These networks consist of layers of interconnected nodes (or neurons) that process and transform input data to produce an output. Deep learning is termed "deep" because it often involves the use of deep neural networks, which have multiple layers (deep architectures) that enable the model to learn hierarchical representations of data.

**Keras: A High-Level Deep Learning Framework:**

Keras is an open-source deep learning library written in Python. It serves as a high-level neural networks API that allows for easy and fast experimentation with deep learning models. Developed with a focus on user friendliness, modularity, and extensibility, Keras has become a popular choice for both beginners and experienced researchers.

Key features of Keras include:

1. **User-Friendly Interface:** Keras provides a simple and intuitive interface, making it easy for users to build, experiment with, and deploy deep learning models.

2. **Modularity:** Keras allows for the construction of models using a modular approach, where building blocks (layers) can be easily combined to create complex neural network architectures.

3. **Compatibility:** It is designed to be compatible with multiple backends, including TensorFlow and Theano, allowing users to choose the backend that best fits their needs.

4. **Extensibility:** Keras supports custom layers, loss functions, and metrics, enabling users to create and incorporate their own components into the deep learning models.

**Basic Steps in Deep Learning with Keras:**

1. **Import Libraries:** Begin by importing the necessary libraries, including Keras and the chosen backend (e.g., TensorFlow).

   ```python
   from keras.models import Sequential
   from keras.layers import Dense
   ```

2. **Build the Model:** Create a sequential model and add layers to it.

   ```python
   model = Sequential()
   model.add(Dense(units=64, activation='relu', input_dim=100))
   model.add(Dense(units=10, activation='softmax'))
   ```

3. **Compile the Model:** Specify the optimizer, loss function, and metrics to be used during training.

   ```python
   model.compile(optimizer='sgd', loss='categorical_crossentropy', metrics=['accuracy'])
   ```

4. **Train the Model:** Provide training data and labels to the model for learning.

   ```python
   model.fit(x_train, y_train, epochs=10, batch_size=32)
   ```

5. **Evaluate and Predict:** Evaluate the model's performance on test data and make predictions.

   ```python
   loss_and_metrics = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test, batch_size=128)
   predictions = model.predict(x_new_data)
   ```
**Sentiment Analysis of Reviews:**

Deep learning, a subset of machine learning, is a powerful approach for solving complex tasks by training artificial neural networks. One practical application is sentiment analysis, where deep learning models can be trained to determine the sentiment expressed in text data. One popular and user-friendly framework for implementing such models is Keras.
Keras simplifies the process of building and training deep learning models, making it accessible to a broad audience, from beginners to experienced researchers and practitioners in the field of artificial intelligence.
